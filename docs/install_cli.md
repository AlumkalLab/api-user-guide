title: Install and Configure the CLI

The primary method for interacting with the SD2E platform is the Agave command
line interface (CLI). The CLI is a collection of ~150 shell scripts for managing
authorization, files, systems, jobs, and more. 

There are three methods to install the CLI:
1. Run an installer script to install in ~/sd2e-cloud-cli/bin/
2. Manual install to a location of your choosing
3. Pull a CLI Docker image

<br>
#### Run an installer script to install in ~/sd2e-cloud-cli/bin/

Open a terminal window and run the installer script:
```
% curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sd2e/sd2e-cli/master/install/install.sh | sh
```

This will install the executables and write an `export PATH` command to your
`~/.bashrc`. To make the changes take effect immediately:
```
% source ~/.bashrc
```

Finally, verify that the CLI has been installed by issuing the following:
```
% sd2e info

DARPA SD2E version 1.0.1
TACC Cloud API tenant: sd2e
TACC Cloud API versions:
        Science APIs: 2.2.5
        Reactors API: dev
        TACC Accounting API: v1
```

<br>
#### Manual install to a location of your choosing

Open a terminal window and navigate to your preferred location for installation:

```
% mkdir sd2e-project && cd sd2e-project
```

Download and unpack the CLI:
```
% curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sd2e/sd2e-cli/master/sd2e-cloud-cli.tgz -o sd2e-cloud-cli.tgz
% tar -xvzf sd2e-cloud-cli.tgz
```

Then add the CLI executables to your `PATH`:
```
% echo "PATH=\$PATH:$PWD/sd2e-cloud-cli/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
% source ~/.bashrc
```

Finally, verify that the CLI has been installed by issuing the following:
```
% sd2e info

DARPA SD2E version 1.0.1
TACC Cloud API tenant: sd2e
TACC Cloud API versions:
	Science APIs: 2.2.5
	Reactors API: dev
```

<br>
#### Pull a CLI Docker image

The CLI is also available as a Docker image. For this to work, it is assumed you
have a reasonably recent version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
Pull the latest image and verify CLI availability by performing:
```
% docker pull sd2e/cloud-cli:latest
% docker run -it -v $HOME/.agave:/root/.agave sd2e/cloud-cli bash
```

Then from within Docker:
```
/home$ sd2e info

DARPA SD2E version 1.0.1
TACC Cloud API tenant: sd2e
TACC Cloud API versions:
	Science APIs: 2.2.5
	Reactors API: dev
```

#### Influential environment variables

 * AGAVE_TENANT
 * AGAVE_USERNAME
 * AGAVE_KEY
 * AGAVE_JSON_PARSER = {json_mirror, jq, json, python, native}
 * AGAVE_DISABLE_AUTO_REFRESH
