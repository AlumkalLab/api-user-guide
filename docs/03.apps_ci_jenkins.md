title: Continuous Integration with Jenkins
tagline:

The SD2E project uses [Jenkins](http://jenkins.sd2e.org/) for continuous
integration (CI). It is now standard practice to set up CI for all Agave apps.
This will ensure your deployed app is always up to date with the master branch
of your git repo, and it will alert you if jobs are not working.
