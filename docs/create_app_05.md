Congratulations! You built and deployed your own Agave app on the SD2E tenant.
Consider sharing your work with others in the following ways:

<br>
#### Contribute your app to the SD2E github repo

Others may be interested to see your app bundle in the SD2E github repo. If you 
would like to contribute, create a pull request to the repository here:

<https://github.com/SD2E/reactors-etl>

Make your best effort to follow the same conventions (directory structure, naming
scheme, etc.) as the other apps in that repo. Also, carefully consider the size
of your app bundle. Github does not deal well with large source files and example
data, so if you can keep your app bundle to a few MB, that would be ideal.


<br> 
#### Contribute your image to the SD2E Docker hub

The SD2E Docker hub contains the run-time images of many packages that can be 
run as apps in the SD2E tenant. If you would like to commit your image to
the SD2E Docker hub, send an e-mail to `support-at-sd2e-dot-org`.
