An Agave *system* is a server or collection of servers associated with a single
hostname. They may be public or private, and they may either be STORAGE systems
(used for storing files) or HPC systems (used for running jobs).

We provide a script for you to generate private HPC and STORAGE systems. You need:

* ssh tokens
* hostname
* paths
