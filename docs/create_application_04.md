At this stage, most of the files are ready to go. Your directory structure
should be similar to:
```
fastqc/
├── Dockerfile                 # done !
├── build.sh                   # done !

    └── fastqc_v0.11.5.zip     # done ! (optional)
```
The final step required before you can run the app is to edit the `json` file
descriptions so your app is compatible with Agave.

<br>
#### Write the app description

The Agave app description is contained in `app.json`.


The YAML file (`app.yml`) is probably not strictly necessary. It is a clone of
the `app.json` file, just in a different format.


<br>
#### Write a job template

Instructions for running an instance of an app (a job), are located in the 
`job.json` file.


<br>
#### Inspect and run the deploy script

```
% bash deploy.sh
```


<br>
#### Run a test job

```
% jobs-submit -F job.json
```
