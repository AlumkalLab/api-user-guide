#### Create a TACC account
 
To create a TACC username and password, please visit this site:

<https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/web/tup/account-request>

You must agree to the TACC Acceptable Use Policy, and then fill out the Account Request form. 

After submitting the Account Request form, you should receive a confirmation email.  Please go ahead and confirm.

Once your email is confirmed, your account request will then be reviewed.  Account approval should occur within 1 business day.  You should receive an email when your account is approved.

After your account is approved, please log back into the TACC Portal <https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu> and complete Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). For MFA, follow the TACC Auth App instructions, and we suggest substituting in the Google Authenticator App instead. MFA instructions are available here:  <https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/tutorials/multifactor-authentication>.
